<!-- A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. 
Worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface.
A worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g. Worker()) that runs a named JavaScript file â€”
 this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread; workers run in another global context that is different from the current window.
 
You can run whatever code you like inside the worker thread, with some exceptions.
 For example, you can't directly manipulate the DOM from inside a worker, or use some default methods and properties of the window object
 . But you can use a large number of items available under window, including WebSockets, and data storage mechanisms like IndexedDB.
